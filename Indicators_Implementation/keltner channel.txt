   keltner channel:

In keltner channel there are 3 lines, the middle line representing the exponential moving average of a
 specific period which I choose to be 25 days , the upper and lower lines representing the middle line 
+- multiplier time the ATR , It gives us a brief idea about how the market will perform in the future,
 in most of the cases the market stays in the range of ATR ,the multiplier is choose is 2 as it present
 me a good idea of how the market is moving
